# SoCET_Half_Precision_FPU
SystemVerilog implementation of half precision floating point unit

Multiplication: 
  - Functional for most numbers I've checked by hand (Including infinities, qNans/sNans, and sub-normals).
    - Current testing is plugging numbers in by hand so have only tested ~10 of each type
  - Khoi is writing testbench so that we can finalize module.

Addition: N/A
